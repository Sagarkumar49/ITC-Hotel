# ITC-Hotel
As a data analyst, I spearheaded a Power BI dashboard project for ITC Hotels, transforming raw booking data into actionable insights to boost revenue, reduce cancellations, and enhance occupancy rates.

Key Highlights:

ðŸ”¹ Built an interactive dashboard tracking financial performance, occupancy trends, and booking behavior.


ðŸ”¹ Uncovered critical insights:

Luxury rooms generated â‚¹560M revenue (highest among categories).

43.5% occupancy rate with a perfect 1.0 correlation to revenue growth.

24.83% cancellation rate, costing ~â‚¹20K in lost revenue.
ðŸ”¹ Developed data-backed strategies, including dynamic pricing, upselling premium rooms, and targeted loyalty programs.

Technical Execution:
âœ” Data Cleaning & Modeling: Processed messy hotel data using Power Query.
âœ” Advanced DAX Formulas: Calculated KPIs like ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR, MoM/WoW growth.
âœ” Visual Storytelling: Designed intuitive dashboards for real-time decision-making.

Business Impact:
The insights helped ITC Hotels identify:
âœ… Revenue leaks (e.g., high cancellations in premium rooms).
âœ… Untapped opportunities (e.g., last-minute booking promotions).
âœ… Optimal pricing strategies to maximize RevPAR.

Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Power Query, Excel
Outcome: A scalable analytics framework to drive 5-10% revenue growth through data-led decisions.
